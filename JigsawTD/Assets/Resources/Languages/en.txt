PLACERULE=Placement Rule
PLANROUTE=Plan a Route
COMPOSITERULE=Composition Rule
GUIDEVIDEO01=Each module consists of three basic tile and a turret. The basic tile can serves as path while the turret can act as a obstacle.
GUIDEVIDEO02=Note: Turret can only be placed on empty tile or basic tile while the basic tile can be placed anywhere.
GUIDEVIDEO03=If you want to extend the path, you need to place basic tile in advance, and then place turret as an obstacle.
GUIDEVIDEO04=Tip: You can also buy a single basic tile by clicking on a empty tile.
GUIDEVIDEO05=When you have all the elements of a blueprint, you can composite a turret. Composite turret have different effects depending on it's elements.
GUIDEVIDEO06=Tip: The store refreshes every 3 waves. However you can buy and keep the blueprint you want.
