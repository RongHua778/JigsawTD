GUIDEVIDEO01=Each module consists of three basic tile and a turret. The basic tile can serves as path while the turret can act as a obstacle.
GUIDEVIDEO02=Note: Turret can only be placed on empty tile or basic tile while the basic tile can be placed anywhere.
GUIDEVIDEO03=If you want to extend the path, you need to place basic tile in advance, and then place turret as an obstacle.
GUIDEVIDEO04=Tip: You can also buy a single basic tile by clicking on a empty tile.
GUIDEVIDEO05=When you have all the elements of a blueprint, you can composite a turret. Composite turret have different effects depending on it's elements.
GUIDEVIDEO06=Tip: The store refreshes every 3 waves. However you can buy and keep the blueprint you want.
GUIDEVIDEO07=The mark will be revealed when a route is passing the tile. Each mark will trigger a special effect when the enemy passes by.
GUIDEVIDEO08=Tip: you can spend some coins to change the mark to another location
GUIDEVIDEO09=Each refactor turret has an unique element skill according to it's element combination. You can put the new turret on the existing turret to make it have additional element skills, but doing so will consume the new turret.
GUIDEVIDEO10=Tip: each refactor turret can only be equipped with 1 additional element skill by default, depending on it's number of element skill slots.

Guide34=Let me introduce the module system.
Guide35=The module button displays your current module \nlevel and the coins required to upgrade it.
Guide36=You don't have to build every turn to save enough \ncoins for upgrades.
